# 🎨 YouTube – Revert Glass UI (Stylus)

Bring back the **classic glass UI** feel to YouTube with this Stylus CSS.  
Designed to work smoothly across common layouts and popular extensions.

## ✅ Compatibility

This CSS has been tested and works with:

- **Fullscreen**
- **Theater mode** (mostly OK)
- **Enhancer for YouTube**
- **SponsorBlock**

📝 You can also use this script **without any extensions**.

If something breaks, **leave a review describing the issue** — I’ll reply ASAP.

## ⚙️ Optional Features

This CSS includes **two optional tweaks** you can enable or disable easily:

1. **Always-visible “Skip” button**
   - Visible even when *not* in a playlist
   - Added because YouTube randomly hid it (and I use it a lot)

2. **Volume slider color**
   - Red by default

🔍 To customize these:
- Open the CSS
- Search for **`OPTION`**
- Comment out anything you don’t want
