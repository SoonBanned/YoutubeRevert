This CSS now works for theses cases :
Fullscreen
(Theater seems okay)
Enhancer For Youtube
SponsorBlock

Note that you can use this script without the extensions.
If something breaks leave a review telling the problem I'll reply to you asap.

You have 2 optionnal things in this CSS, first the Skip button that I made visible even when not in a playlist, because I used this one a lot and it disappeared, second, the color of the volume slider (it is red by default now) you can search in the theme "OPTION" to comment the options you don't like.

TODO (not urgent):
Fix youtube embeds
I forgot hover effect (Sponsorblock) when not fullscreen so it looks weird
